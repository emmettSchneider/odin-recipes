    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These pepperoni rolls are just like the amazingly unique pepperoni rolls found in almost all convenience stores in West Virginia and Southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p> A slightly sweet fluffy dough with spicy pepperoni makes for a delicious treat!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (100 degrees F/40 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together 1 cup warm water and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves. Sprinkle yeast over water; let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, 3/4 cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in yeast mixture, beaten eggs, and melted butter until dough comes together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough into a greased bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth; let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough; divide into 20 equal pieces about the size of a golf ball. Using your hands, flatten each piece into a small rectangle, about 4 inches square.</li>
        <li>Place 3 overlapping slices of pepperoni down the center of each dough square. Place another row of 3 pepperoni slices next to the first. Roll dough around pepperoni, pinch the edges closed, and place rolls on the prepared cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until bottoms are lightly browned and tops are barely golden, 14 to 16 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
